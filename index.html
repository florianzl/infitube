      In volatile times you need to be fast. <br />

      You need to be water, not stone. <br />

      The prepper approach is to bunker down, fortify, and become HARD. <br />

      They don’t understand that some attacks are overwhelmingly powerful.
      <br />

      Some attacks cannot be blocked without significant damage. <br />

      The only solution is to move. <br />

      Like water. <br />

      When an attack comes, be far away from the impact zone by the time it
      arrives. <br />

      I’ve preached for 5 years publicly to you all to get multiple residencies
      and passports. <br />

      I told you all what was coming and to be prepared. <br />

      I told you all to be liquid. <br />

      To be FAST. <br />

      You cannot stay surrounded by slow people. <br />

      The sloth doesn’t understand the definition of speed until he surrounds
      himself with a cheetah. <br />

      Fix the speed rate at which you live your life. <br />

      Understand: the level of sloth at which you live is unacceptable for any
      man with any ambition for greatness. <br />

      Your decision-making, the speed at which you walk, the speed at which you
      are prepared to get on the jet or change your job. <br />

      It needs to be sped up 10X. <br />

      Only once you’ve seen an attack coming AND can move fast enough to
      reposition by the time the blow lands. <br />

      Only THEN. <br />

      You can profit from it. <br />

      The chaos has only just begun. <br />
      <br />
